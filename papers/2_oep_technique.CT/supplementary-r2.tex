\section{Statistical validation of OEP method}

In Figure~\ref{f:fig-s2} interaction energy components
obtained by using the code developed in this work are
compared to the ones obtained by using the EFP2 calculation routines
in GAMESS US quantum chemistry package\cite{GAMESS.JCC.1993} (version: Sept 30, 2017 R2 Public Release). 
For this, EFP2 parameters
were generated by running the \texttt{MAKEFP} routine
with \texttt{CTVVO} option switched to \texttt{.FALSE.} which corresponds
to using all the canonical molecular orbitals from HF calculations
instead of valence virtual orbitals.
Generally, Coulombic energies (Figure~S2(a)) 
are in very good agreement with a few exeptions in the PPS5 set,
for which the differences are due to the inaccuracies in the DMTP
expansion used in the EFP2 model -- note that the Coulombic component in the DDS/HF method
is free from multipole approximation and is equivalent to the first\hyp{}order SAPT Coulombic energy.
Exchange\hyp{}repulsion and induction energies (Figures~S2(b) and S2(c), respectively)
are in very good agreement. CT energies (Figure~S2(d)) 
evaluated with CAMM up to quadrupoles for the potential energy matrix elements (black filled circles)
are generally also in decent quantitative agreement,
except for NH$_3$--FCl, (HCOOH)$_2$ and (HCONH$_2$)$_2$ 
%and parallel\hyp{}displaced benzene dimer
where the differences
are between 2--4 kcal/mol. Only in the case of the latter three systems,
adding distributed octupoles (blue crosses in Figure~S2(d)) 
lowers the CT energy values by around 1 kcal/mol,
with negligible changes for the rest.

with respect to the EFP2 GAMESS US code.} 
Results obtained for the NCB31 database set assuming 6-311++G(d,p) primary basis set. 
(a) - Coulombic, (b) - exchange-repulsion, (c) - induction, and (d) - charge-transfer
interaction energy. In (d), black circles and blue crosses correspond to the
CT EFP2 energies with CAMM up to distributed quadrupoles and octupoles, respectively.
