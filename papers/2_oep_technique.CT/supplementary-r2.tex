\caption{\label{f:fig-s1} {\bf Asymptotic dependence of the charge transfer energy
in the CT/HF0 formulation for water-methanol complex.} 
Water molecule has been translated by $R$ from the starting geometry
along the vector specified in the inset picture.
The counterpoise\hyp{}corrected total interaction energy
is also shown for comparison in light grey color in this figure.
All data were obtained at HF/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level of theory
with the single GDF scheme and aug-cc-pVTZ-jkfit auxiliary basis set.
