A revised procedure is proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The resulting procedure is very stable and the calculated multipole moments converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.},

abstract  ="Systematic probing of local environments around biopolymers is important for understanding their functions. Therefore{,} there has been growing interest in in situ measurements of molecular granularity and heterogeneity through the systematic analysis of vibrational frequency shifts of carbonyl and nitrile infrared probes by vibrational Stark dipole theory. However{,} here we show that the nitrile vibrational frequency shift induced by its interaction with the surrounding molecules cannot be solely described by electric field-based theory because of the exchange–repulsion and dispersion interaction contributions. Considering a variety of molecular environments ranging from bulk solutions to protein environments{,} we explore the distinct scenarios of solute-environment contacts and their traces in vibrational frequency shifts. We believe that the present work could provide a set of clues that could be potentially used to design a rigorous theoretical model linking vibrational solvatochromism and molecular topology in complex heterogeneous environments."}

abstract="Based on a general discussion of orthogonalization effects, two new one-electron orthogonalization corrections are derived to improve existing semiempirical models at the neglect of diatomic differential overlap level. The first one accounts for valence-shell orthogonalization effects on the resonance integrals, while the second one includes the dominant repulsive core--valence interactions through an effective core potential. The corrections for the resonance integrals consist of three-center terms which incorporate stereodiscriminating properties into the two-center matrix elements of the core Hamiltonian. They provide a better description of conformational properties, which is rationalized qualitatively and demonstrated through numerical calculations on small model systems. The proposed corrections are part of a new general-purpose semiempirical method which will be described elsewhere.",

The method relies on the use of SCF optimized monomer orbitais in dimer calculations in which the wavefunction of one monomer is held frozen while the other is optimized with a basis set including selected subsets of the unoccupied monomer orbitals. Freezing the monomer wavefunctions allows the polarizability and charge-transfer interactions to be ascribed to specific monomers. Applications are presented for the interaction energy and dipole moment of the water dimer."

abstract = {Abstract An improved method for computing potential-derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.1 This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

abstract = {Abstract A detailed description of the implementation of the effective fragment potential (EFP) method in the Q-CHEM electronic structure package is presented. The Q-CHEM implementation interfaces EFP with standard quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster methods, as well as with methods for electronically excited and open-shell species, for example, configuration interaction, time-dependent density functional theory, and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster models. In addition to the QM/EFP functionality, a “fragment-only” feature is also available (when the system is described by effective fragments only). To aid further developments of the EFP methodology, a detailed description of the C++ classes and EFP module's workflow is presented. The EFP input structure and EFP job options are described. To assist setting up and performing EFP calculations, a collection of Perl service scripts is provided. The precomputed EFP parameters for standard fragments such as common solvents are stored in Q-CHEM's auxiliary library; they can be easily invoked, similar to specifying standard basis sets. The instructions for generating user-defined EFP parameters are given. Fragments positions can be specified by their center of mass coordinates and Euler angles. The interface with the IQMOL and WEBMO software is also described. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In DNTEFP, several important concepts are combined to facilitate the computation of the evaporation rates—dynamical nucleation theory Monte Carlo (DNTMC), the effective fragment potential, and two-level parallelism. The chapter presents a brief introduction to each of the concepts to acclimate the reader to the ideas. The chapter also presents the results of the use of the DNTEFP method to study several chemical systems. Next, it discusses an assessment of the performance of the software. The investigated chemical systems are representative of different types of calculations that can be performed using the DNTEFP method—homogeneous water clusters, heterogeneous water clusters with ions, and homogeneous dehydrated systems.}

abstract = {Abstract Evaluation of the electrostatic energy within the effective fragment potential (EFP) method is presented. The performance of two variants of the distributed multipole analysis (DMA) together with two different models for estimating the charge penetration energies was studied using six homonuclear dimers. The importance of damping the higher order multipole terms, i.e. charge dipole, was also investigated. Damping corrections recover more than 70\% of the charge penetration energy in all dimers, whereas higher order damping introduces only minor improvement. Electrostatic energies calculated by the numerical DMA are less accurate than those calculated by the analytic DMA. Analysis of bonding in the benzene dimer shows that EFP with inclusion of the electrostatic damping term performs very well compared to the high-level coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples method. The largest error of 0.4 kcal/mol occurs for the sandwich dimer configuration. This error is about half the size of the corresponding error in second order perturbation theory. Thus, EFP in the current implementation is an accurate and computationally inexpensive method for calculating interaction energies in weakly bonded molecular complexes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract  ="Fragment methods have been widely studied for computing energies and forces{,} but less attention has been paid to nonenergetic properties. Here we extend the electrostatically embedded many-body (EE-MB) method to the calculation of cluster dipole moments{,} dipole moments of molecules in clusters{,} partial atomic charges{,} and charge transfer{,} and we test and validate the method by comparing to results calculated for the entire system without fragmentation. We also compare to calculations carried out by the conventional many-body (MB) method without electrostatic embedding. Systems considered are NH3(H2O)11{,} (NH3)2(H2O)14{,} [Cl(H2O)6]−{,} (HF)4{,} (HF)5{,} (HF)2H2O{,} (HF)3H2O{,} and (HF)3(H2O)2. With electrostatic embedding{,} we find that even at the pairwise additive level a quantitatively accurate description of a system{'}s dipole moment and partial charge distribution and a qualitatively accurate description of the amount of intermolecular charge transfer can often be obtained."}
