A revised procedure is proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The resulting procedure is very stable and the calculated multipole moments converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.},

abstract="Based on a general discussion of orthogonalization effects, two new one-electron orthogonalization corrections are derived to improve existing semiempirical models at the neglect of diatomic differential overlap level. The first one accounts for valence-shell orthogonalization effects on the resonance integrals, while the second one includes the dominant repulsive core--valence interactions through an effective core potential. The corrections for the resonance integrals consist of three-center terms which incorporate stereodiscriminating properties into the two-center matrix elements of the core Hamiltonian. They provide a better description of conformational properties, which is rationalized qualitatively and demonstrated through numerical calculations on small model systems. The proposed corrections are part of a new general-purpose semiempirical method which will be described elsewhere.",

The method relies on the use of SCF optimized monomer orbitais in dimer calculations in which the wavefunction of one monomer is held frozen while the other is optimized with a basis set including selected subsets of the unoccupied monomer orbitals. Freezing the monomer wavefunctions allows the polarizability and charge-transfer interactions to be ascribed to specific monomers. Applications are presented for the interaction energy and dipole moment of the water dimer."

abstract = {Abstract An improved method for computing potential-derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.1 This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},
