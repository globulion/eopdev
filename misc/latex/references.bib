A revised procedure is proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The resulting procedure is very stable and the calculated multipole moments converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.},

  abstract = {The theory of intermolecular force has advanced greatly in the last ten or fifteen years. The improved experimental and computational methods have made it possible to develop much more meticulous descriptions, and simple empirical models are no longer adequate to account for the detailed and accurate experimental measurements that are now available. Therefore a knowledge of advanced mathematical techniques is essential. The Theory of Intermolecular Forces is the first book to fully describe these techniques. Stone explains recent advances and sets out the mathematical techniques needed to handle the more elaborate models being used increasingly by both theoreticians and experimentalists in spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, and molecular modeling. Techniques described include the use of higher-rank multipole moments to describe electrostatic interactions, Cartesian and spherical tensor methods, and modern ab initio perturbation theories of intermolecular interactions},

It has become possible to carry out accurate calculations of intermolecular forces for molecules of useful size, and to apply the results to important practical applications such as understanding protein structure and function, and predicting the structures of molecular crystals. The Theory of Intermolecular Forces sets out the mathematical techniques that are needed to describe and calculate intermolecular interactions and to handle the more elaborate mathematical models. It describes the methods that are used to calculate them, including recent developments in the use of density functional theory and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. The use of higher-rank multipole moments to describe electrostatic interactions is explained in both Cartesian and spherical tensor formalism, and methods that avoid the multipole expansion are also discussed. Modern ab initio perturbation theory methods for the calculation of intermolecular interactions are discussed in detail, and methods for calculating properties of molecular clusters and condensed matter for comparison with experiment are surveyed.},

abstract  ="Systematic probing of local environments around biopolymers is important for understanding their functions. Therefore{,} there has been growing interest in in situ measurements of molecular granularity and heterogeneity through the systematic analysis of vibrational frequency shifts of carbonyl and nitrile infrared probes by vibrational Stark dipole theory. However{,} here we show that the nitrile vibrational frequency shift induced by its interaction with the surrounding molecules cannot be solely described by electric field-based theory because of the exchange–repulsion and dispersion interaction contributions. Considering a variety of molecular environments ranging from bulk solutions to protein environments{,} we explore the distinct scenarios of solute-environment contacts and their traces in vibrational frequency shifts. We believe that the present work could provide a set of clues that could be potentially used to design a rigorous theoretical model linking vibrational solvatochromism and molecular topology in complex heterogeneous environments."}

The first one accounts for valence-shell orthogonalization effects on the resonance integrals, while the second one includes the dominant repulsive core--valence interactions through an effective core potential. The corrections for the resonance integrals consist of three-center terms which incorporate stereodiscriminating properties into the two-center matrix elements of the core Hamiltonian. They provide a better description of conformational properties, which is rationalized qualitatively and demonstrated through numerical calculations on small model systems. The proposed corrections are part of a new general-purpose semiempirical method which will be described elsewhere.",

The method relies on the use of SCF optimized monomer orbitais in dimer calculations in which the wavefunction of one monomer is held frozen while the other is optimized with a basis set including selected subsets of the unoccupied monomer orbitals. Freezing the monomer wavefunctions allows the polarizability and charge-transfer interactions to be ascribed to specific monomers. Applications are presented for the interaction energy and dipole moment of the water dimer."

abstract = {Abstract An improved method for computing potential-derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.1 This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential-derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally-spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},

abstract  ="Fragment methods have been widely studied for computing energies and forces{,} but less attention has been paid to nonenergetic properties. Here we extend the electrostatically embedded many-body (EE-MB) method to the calculation of cluster dipole moments{,} dipole moments of molecules in clusters{,} partial atomic charges{,} and charge transfer{,} and we test and validate the method by comparing to results calculated for the entire system without fragmentation. We also compare to calculations carried out by the conventional many-body (MB) method without electrostatic embedding. Systems considered are NH3(H2O)11{,} (NH3)2(H2O)14{,} [Cl(H2O)6]−{,} (HF)4{,} (HF)5{,} (HF)2H2O{,} (HF)3H2O{,} and (HF)3(H2O)2. With electrostatic embedding{,} we find that even at the pairwise additive level a quantitatively accurate description of a system{'}s dipole moment and partial charge distribution and a qualitatively accurate description of the amount of intermolecular charge transfer can often be obtained."}

abstract  ="A method that we have recently introduced for rapid computation of intermolecular interaction energies is reformulated and subjected to further tests. The method employs monomer-based self-consistent field calculations with an electrostatic embedding designed to capture many-body polarization (the “XPol” procedure){,} augmented by pairwise symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to capture dispersion and exchange interactions along with any remaining induction effects. A rigorous derivation of the XPol+SAPT methodology is presented here{,} which demonstrates that the method is systematically improvable{,} and moreover introduces some additional intermolecular interactions as compared to the more heuristic derivation that was presented previously. Applications to various non-covalent complexes and clusters are presented{,} including geometry optimizations and one-dimensional potential energy scans. The performance of the XPol+SAPT methodology in its present form (based on second-order intermolecular perturbation theory and neglecting intramolecular electron correlation) is qualitatively acceptable across a wide variety of systems—and quantitatively quite good in certain cases—but the quality of the results is rather sensitive to the choice of one-particle basis set. Basis sets that work well for dispersion-bound systems offer less-than-optimal performance for clusters dominated by induction and electrostatic interactions{,} and vice versa. A compromise basis set is identified that affords good results for both induction and dispersion interactions{,} although this favorable performance ultimately relies on error cancellation{,} as in traditional low-order SAPT. Suggestions for future improvements to the methodology are discussed."}
