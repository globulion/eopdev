List of One-Electron Potentals
==============================

Here I provide the list of OEP’s that have been already derived within the scope of the OEPDev project. 

Pauli Repulsion OEP’s
---------------------

The following potentials are derived for the evaluation of the Pauli repulsion energy based on Murrel’s expressions.
