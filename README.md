Overview
--------

Test various models of the intermolecular interaction
that is based on the application of the **Effective One-electron Potentials (EOP's)**
technique.

Currently, the interaction between two molecules 
described by the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan-Hall theory 
or the configuration interaction with singles theory is considered. 
In particular, the plugin tests the models of:

*******
  1. the charge-transfer interaction energy             (Project I  ) 
  2. the excitation energy transfer couplings           (Project I  )
  3. the Pauli exchange-repulsion interaction energy    (Project II ) 
  4. the polarization of electronic density             (Project III)

*******

against reference solutions (exact or other approximations).
