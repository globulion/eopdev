EOP-Dev
=======

Generalized Effective One-Electron Potentials: Development Platform.

Contact: Bartosz Błasiak (blasiak.bartosz@gmail.com)

Overview
--------

Test various models of the intermolecular interaction
that is based on the application of the **Effective One-electron Potentials (EOP's)**
technique.

Currently, the interaction between two molecules 
described by the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan-Hall theory 
or the configuration interaction with singles theory is considered. 
In particular, the plugin tests the models of:

*******
  1. the Pauli exchange-repulsion interaction energy    (Project II ) 
  2. the charge-transfer interaction energy             (Project I  ) 
  3. the polarization of electronic density             (Project III)
  4. the excitation energy transfer couplings           (Project I  )

*******

against reference solutions (exact or other approximations).

This wikipages will be updated soon.
